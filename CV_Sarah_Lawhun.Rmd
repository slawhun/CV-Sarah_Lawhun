#### **Why you should hire me to spend time with your cat:**

* Cats *love* me. I have an innate ability to please them.
* I have worked at animal shelters and have experience taking care of cats
* I speak the language of cats. They simply understand me and I understand them
* If you don't hire me, <ins> *I will break into your house and steal your cat* <ins>
* I may or may not be a cat
* Meow
