#### **Why you should hire me to spend time with your cat:**

- Cats *love* me. I have an innate ability to please them.
- I have worked at animal shelters and have experience taking care of
  cats
- I speak the language of cats. They simply understand me and I
  understand them
- If you don’t hire me, <ins> *I will break into your house and steal
  your cat* <ins>
- I may or may not be a cat
- Meow
